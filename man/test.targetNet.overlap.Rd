\title{Test for Intersection of Target Genes between Two Drivers}
\usage{
test.targetNet.overlap(
  source1_label = NULL,
  source2_label = NULL,
  target1 = NULL,
  target2 = NULL,
  total_possible_target = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{source1_label}{character, the label of the first selected driver.}

\item{source2_label}{character, the label of the second selected driver.}

\item{target1}{a vector of characters, the list of target genes from the first driver.}

\item{target2}{a vector of characters, the list of target genes from the second driver.}

\item{total_possible_target}{numeric or a vector of characters. If input is numeric, it is the total number of possible target genes.
If input is a vector of characters, it is the background list of all possible target genes.}
}
\value{
Return statistics of the testing, including the \code{P.Value}, \code{Odds_Ratio} and \code{Intersected_Number}.
}
\description{
\code{test.targetNet.overlap} performs Fisher's exact test to see whether the target genes from two drivers are significantly intersected.
}
