\title{Combine P Values Using Fisher's Method or Stouffer's Method}
\usage{
combinePvalVector(pvals, method = "Stouffer", signed = TRUE, twosided = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{a vector of numerics, the P values from multiple comparison need to be combined.}

\item{method}{character, users can choose between "Stouffer" and "Fisher". Default is "Stouffer".}

\item{signed}{logical, if TRUE, will give a sign to the P value to indicate the direction of testing.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{twosided}{logical, if TRUE, P value is calculated in a one-tailed test.
If FALSE, P value is calculated in a two-tailed test, and it falls within the range 0 to 0.5.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Return a vector contains the "Z-statistics" and "P.Value".
}
\description{
\code{combinePvalVector} is a function to combine multiple comparison's P values using Fisher's method or Stouffer's method.
